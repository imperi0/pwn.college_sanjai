# Perceiving Permissions

## Changing file ownership
In this level, we will practice changing the owner of the /flag file to the hacker user, and then read the flag. For this challenge only, I made it so that you can use chown to your heart's content as the hacker user (again, typically, this requires you to be root). Use this power wisely and chown away!

### Solve
In this challenge, I used chown command and changed the ownership of /flag file to hacker and used cat on it to get the flag.

## Groups and files
In this level, I have made the flag readable by whatever group owns it, but this group is currently root. Luckily, I have also made it possible for you to invoke chgrp as the hacker user! Change the group ownership of the flag file, and read the flag!

### Solve
In this level i used chgrp to change group of the /flag

## FUn with group names
The point is, you've used hacker for the group before, but in this level, that is not going to work. I'll still allow you to use chgrp, but I have randomized the name of the group that your user is in. You will need to use the id command to figure that name out, then chgrp to victory!

### Solve
In this level i used group id to change the group

## Changing permissions
In this level, we will cover the former: modifying an existing mode. chmod allows you to tweak permissions with the mode format of WHO+/-WHAT, where WHO is user/group/other and WHAT is read/write/execute. 

### Solve
In this level I learned to use change the permissions of a file using chmod

## Executable files
In this challenge, the /challenge/run program will give you the flag, but you must first make it executable!

## Permission Tweaking Practice
This level is testing the level of understanding of chmod and my patience.

### Solve
Since i knew already about how to change permissions using numbers i used that method.

## Permissions Setting Practice
This level extends the previous level by requesting more radical permission changes, which you will need = and ,-chaining to achieve

### Solve
Same as previous level

## The SUID bit
Now, we are going to let you add the SUID bit to the /challenge/getroot program in order to spawn a root shell for you to cat the flag yourself!
