# Perceiving Permissions

### Changing file ownership

In this level, we will practice changing the owner of the /flag file to the hacker user, and then read the flag. For this challenge only, I made it so that you can use chown to your heart's content as the hacker user (again, typically, this requires you to be root). Use this power wisely and chown away!

### Groups and files

In this level i used chgrp to change group of the /flag

### Changing permissions

In this level, we will cover the former: modifying an existing mode. chmod allows you to tweak permissions with the mode format of WHO+/-WHAT, where WHO is user/group/other and WHAT is read/write/execute. 

In this level I learned to use change the permissions of a file using chmod

### Executable files

In this challenge, the /challenge/run program will give you the flag, but you must first make it executable!

### Permission Tweaking Practice

This level is testing the level of understanding of chmod and my patience.

Since i knew already about how to change permissions using numbers i used that method.
