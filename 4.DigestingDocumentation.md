## Reading manuals
The challenge in this level has a secret option that, when you use it, will cause the challenge to print the flag. You must learn this option through the man page for challenge!

### Solve
In this challenge, I used man challenge to get the manual and saw one of the descriptions as --kpigmb NUM prints flag, passed the num and got the flag.

### New learnings
Learned how to search for something in a module

## Searching for manuals
This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by randomizing its name. Luckily, all of the manpages are gathered in a searchable database, so you'll be able to search the man page database to find the hidden challenge man page! 

### Solve
When i used man man, i found that man -k is used for searching man page names for a specific keyword . I used it then to get the flag with other basic commands/
