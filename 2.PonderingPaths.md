# Pondering Paths

## The root
You can invoke a program by providing its path on the command line. In this case, you'll be giving the exact path, starting from /, so the path would be /pwn.

In this level i gave the complete path of the program to get the flag

### New learnings 

Learnt how to invoke commands 

## Program and absolute paths
The name of the challenge program in this level is run, and it lives in the /challenge directory. Thus, the path to the run challenge program is /challenge/run.

In this level i used the absolute path to get the flag

## Position thy self
This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you).

In this level i had to change the working directory to different one to invoke /challenge/run to get the flag

### New learnings
Learned to use cd command to change directory

## Position elsewhere
This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you).

Same as last level i had to change the directoy to get the flag

### New learnings 
Same as previous level

## Position yet elsewhere
This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you).

Same as previous 2 levels 

### New learnings 
Same as previous level


## Implicit relative paths, from /
You'll need to run /challenge/run using a relative path while having a current working directory of /.

In this challenge, I used cd command to change directory to / and then ran challenge/run command to get the flag

### New Learnings
Learned how to invoke commands using implicit relative paths.

## Explicit relative paths form /
This challenge will get you using . in your relative paths.

In this challenge, I used cd command to change directory to / and then ran ./challenge/run command by using . in relative path to get the flag.

### New Learnings
Learned how to invoke commands using explicit relative paths.

## Implicit relative path 
In this level, we'll practice referring to paths using . a bit more. This challenge will need you to run it from the /challenge directory.

In this challenge, I used cd command to change directory to /challenge and then ran ./run command by using . in relative path to get the flag.

### New Learnings
Learned how to launch run program explicitly inside a specific directory.

## Home sweet home
In this challenge, /challenge/run will write a copy of the flag to any file you specify as an argument on the commandline, with these constraints:
Your argument must be an absolute path. The path must be inside your home directory. Before expansion, your argument must be three characters or less. Again, you must specify your path as an argument to /challenge/run.

### New Learnings
Learned about the home directory ~ and its absolute path.
