# Practicing Piping


## Redirecting output
In this challenge, you must use this output redirection to write the word PWN (all uppercase) to the filename COLLEGE (all uppercase).

### Solve
I used > to redirect output

### New learnings 
Learned how to redirect output

## Redirecting more output
Aside from redirecting the output of echo, you can, of course, redirect the output of any command. In this level, /challenge/run will once more give you a flag, but only if you redirect its output to the file myflag. Your flag will, of course, end up in the myflag file!

### New learnings 
Same as last level

## Appending output
To practice, run /challenge/run with an append-mode redirect of the output to the file /home/hacker/the-flag. The practice will write the first half of the flag to the file, and the second half to stdout if stdout is redirected to the file. If you properly redirect in append-mode, the second half will be appended to the first, but if you redirect in truncation mode (>), the second half will overwrite the first and you won't get the flag!

### Solve
Used >> to append the two part ouput of the program without losing the first part.

### New learnings
Learned to append to files while redirecting

## Duplicating piped data with tee
This process' /challenge/pwn must be piped into /challenge/college, but you'll need to intercept the data to see what pwn needs from you!

### Solve
In this level i used tee to copy the data that is going to be sent to the next command.

### New Learnings
Learned about duplicating piped data with tee.

## Process substitution for input

<(command) runs command in a subshell and saves the output of that in a temp file like /dev/fd/63 and we can use <(cmd) in place of the file

## Writing to multiple programs
In this challenge, we have /challenge/hack, /challenge/the, and /challenge/planet. Run the /challenge/hack command, and duplicate its output as input to both the /challenge/the and the /challenge/planet commands! 

### Solve
It’s like creating a temporary file that you can write to or read from, but instead of storing it on disk, the system streams the data directly into the command. The command then processes this data just like it would from a normal file. Once the command finishes, the temporary “file” disappears automatically.

This < (command) → runs the command and makes its output look like a file. Other commands can read from this “file” as if it were a normal file. It doesn’t actually create a real file on disk.

THis > (command) → creates a temporary pipe that acts like a file. Anything written into this “file” goes into the command as input. Again, no real file is created; it’s just a live connection

### New Learnings
Learned about writing to multiple programs using tee and >()
