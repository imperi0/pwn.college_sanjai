# File Globbing

## Matching with *
Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use globbing to keep the argument you pass to cd to at most four characters! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

### New learnings
Learned the usage of * 

## Matching with ?
Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

### New learnings
Learned theusage of ?

## Matching with [] 
Change your working directory to /challenge/files and run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h!

### New learnings
Learned the usage of []

## Matching paths with [] 
Starting from your home directory, run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h files!

### New learnings
Learned the usage of [] same as prev level 

## Multiple globs
We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and run /challenge/run, providing a single argument: a short (3 characters or less) globbed word with two * globs in it that covers every word that contains the letter p.

### Solve
I used file globbing techniques to cover all the cases according to the question to get the flag

### New learnings
Learned using multiple globs at the same time 

## Mixing globs
using the globbing you've learned, write a single, short (6 characters or less) glob that (when passed as an argument to /challenge/run) will match the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning"!

### New learnings
Learned how to combine * [] and ? to look for files 

## Exclusionary globbing
go forth to /challenge/files and run /challenge/run with all files that don't start with p, w, or n!

### Solve
I used ! for exclusivly globbing

### New learnings
Learned to use exclusive globs that is using ! or ^

## Tab completion 
This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it. Try it out!

### Solve
I used tab key to auto complete in this level

### New learnings
Learned to use tab key to auto complete

## Multiple options for tab completion 
This challenge has a /challenge/files directory with a bunch of files starting with pwncollege. Tab-complete from /challenge/files/p or so, and make your way to the flag!

### Solve
Same as last level

## Tab completion on commands 
This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

### Solve
In this challenge, I typed in pwncollege and hit TAB to get the flag.
