## CAT : not the pet, but the command
In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the flag file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with cat!

In this level i used cat to read the flag file 

### New Learnings
Learned about cat command and how it works.

In this level i used cat command again to get the flag

### New Learnings
Learned about invoking cat command using absolute paths.

## More catting practice
In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with cd, so no cat flag for you. You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.

### Solve
Same as previous challenge i used the complete path to cat the file

### New Learnings
Practiced more catting commands.

## Grepping for a needle in a haystack
In this challenge, I've put a hundred thousand lines of text into the /challenge/data.txt file. grep it for the flag!

### Solve
In this challenge, I used grep command to search for the string pwn.college in the given text file to get the flag

### New Learnings
Learned about grep command and how to use it.

## Comparing files 
Now for your challenge! There are two files in /challenge:

  /challenge/decoys_only.txt contains 100 fake flags
  /challenge/decoys_and_real.txt contains all 100 fake flags plus the one real flag

### Solve
for this level i used diff command

<img width="591" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fdbe99c-b5aa-4e74-8bcb-8bdf7e421817" />

### New Learnings
Learned about diff command and how it can be used to compare two files line by line.

## Listing files
In this challenge, we've named /challenge/run with some random name! List the files in /challenge to find it.

### Solve 
In this challenge, first I ran ls /challenge command to see which file is renamed. Then used cat to read the renamed file.

### New Learnings
Learned about using ls command and how it works.

## Touching files
It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

### Solve 
I used touch command to create 2 new files 

<img width="448" height="119" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7ad1d6-0fea-42d7-bb98-7920d6346f63" />

### New Learnings
Learned about creating new files using touch command.

## Removing files
This challenge will create a delete_me file in your home directory! Delete it, then run /challenge/check, which will make sure you've deleted it and then give you the flag!

### Solve
I used rm command to remove/delete files

### New learning
Learned to use rm command

## Moving files
This challenge wants you to move the /flag file into /tmp/hack-the-planet (do it)! 

### Solve
I used mv command to moe files from one dir to another/

### New learning 
Learned about mv command

## Hidden files
In this level i should find the hidden flag in the / directory 

### Solve

### New learnings
Learned how to list all files including hidden ones

## An epic filesystem quest 
In this level i went on a filesystem quest to get the flag by going to diff directories and catting different files

### Solve

## Making directories 
Now, go forth and create a /tmp/pwn directory and make a college file in it

### Solve 
Made new dir using mkdir

<img width="439" height="106" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a2a3ea5-9e35-4f3c-abd2-4042d395630e" />

### New learnings
Learned to create a new directory 

## Finding files
I've hidden the flag in a random directory on the filesystem. It's still called flag. Go find it!

Several notes. First, there are other files named flag on the filesystem. Don't panic if the first one you try doesn't have the actual flag in it. Second, there're plenty of places in the filesystem that are not accessible to a normal user. These will cause find to generate errors, but you can ignore those; we won't hide the flag there! Finally, find can take a while; be patient!
 
### Solve
In this level i used find command to find a file named flag which have the flag in it 

<img width="731" height="548" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9732955e-bef3-4769-a4ca-693c9394a133" />

### New Learnings
Learned about finding files using a specific name as argument.

## Linking files
In this level the flag is, as always, in /flag, but /challenge/catflag will instead read out /home/hacker/not-the-flag. Use the symlink, and fool it into giving you the flag!

### Solve 
I had to make the not-the-flag file to point thr /flag so that when catflag reads out not-the-flag itll lead to /flag

### New Learnings
Learned about sym links and how to use ln
