# Comprehending Commands 

### CAT : not the pet, but the command

In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the flag file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with cat!

In this level i used absolute path to read the flag

### More catting practice

Same as previous challenge i used the complete path to cat the file

### Grepping for a needle in a haystack

In this challenge, I've put a hundred thousand lines of text into the /challenge/data.txt file. grep it for the flag!

### Comparing files 

Now for your challenge! There are two files in /challenge:

  /challenge/decoys_only.txt contains 100 fake flags
  /challenge/decoys_and_real.txt contains all 100 fake flags plus the one real flag

for this level i used diff command

### Listing files

In this challenge, we've named /challenge/run with some random name! List the files in /challenge to find it.

### Touching files

It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

### Removing files

This challenge will create a delete_me file in your home directory! Delete it, then run /challenge/check, which will make sure you've deleted it and then give you the flag!

### Moving files

This challenge wants you to move the /flag file into /tmp/hack-the-planet (do it)!

### Hidden files

In this level i should find the hidden flag in the / directory

### An epic filesystem quest 

In this level i went on a filesystem quest to get the flag by going to diff directories and catting different files

<img width="1206" height="591" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5b79dad-5247-4704-bbf5-0d65a14ba522" />

### Making directories 

Now, go forth and create a /tmp/pwn directory and make a college file in it

### Finding files

In this level i used find command to find a file named flag which have the flag in it

### Linking files

 In this level the flag is, as always, in /flag, but /challenge/catflag will instead read out /home/hacker/not-the-flag. Use the symlink, and fool it into giving you the flag!
