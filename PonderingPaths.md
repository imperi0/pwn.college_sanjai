# Pondering Paths

### The root

You can invoke a program by providing its path on the command line. In this case, you'll be giving the exact path, starting from /, so the path would be /pwn.

### Program and absolute paths

The name of the challenge program in this level is run, and it lives in the /challenge directory. Thus, the path to the run challenge program is /challenge/run.

### Position thy self

This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you).

#### Position elsewhere

This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you).

### Position yet elsewhere

This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you).

### Implicit relative paths, from /

You'll need to run /challenge/run using a relative path while having a current working directory of /.
