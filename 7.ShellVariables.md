### Setting variables 

To solve this level, you must set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. Be careful: both the names and values of variables are case-sensitive! PWN is not the same as pwn and COLLEGE is not the same as College.

### Multi-word variables

In this level, you'll need to set the variable PWN to COLLEGE YEAH. Good luck!

### Exporting variables

In this challenge, you must invoke /challenge/run with the PWN variable exported and set to the value COLLEGE, and the COLLEGE variable set to the value PWN but not exported (e.g., not inherited by /challenge/run)

### Printing exported variables

Try the env command: it'll print out every exported variable set in your shell, and you can look through that output to find the FLAG variable!

### Storing command output

Read the output of the /challenge/run command directly into a variable called PWN, and it will contain the flag!

### Reading Input

In this challenge, your job is to use read to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE.

### Reading files 

use that to read /challenge/read_me into the PWN environment variable, and we'll give you the flag! The /challenge/read_me will keep changing, so you'll need to read it right into the PWN variable with one command!
