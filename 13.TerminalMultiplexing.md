## Launching session 
For this challenge, we've hooked things up so that just launching screen will get you the flag. Easy!

## Detaching and attaching 
For this challenge, you'll need to:

Launch screen Detach from it. Run /challenge/run (this will secretly send the flag to your detached session!) Reattach to see your prize

### Solve
I used screen, then did ctrl-A which is its activation key to use shortcuts then pressed d to detach

I tried all reattaching to each session using their PID and found the flag in session with PID 150
