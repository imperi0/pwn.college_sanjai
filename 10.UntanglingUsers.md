# Untangling Users

## Becoming root with su 
This challenge (and only this challenge) does have a root password. That password is hack-the-planet, and you must provide it to su to become root! Go do that, and read the flag!

### Solve
I used su command to become the root(super) user.

## Other users with su 
In this level, you must switch to the zardus user and then run /challenge/run. Zardus' password is dont-hack-me.

### Solve
I used su username to change the user and get the flag.

## Cracking Passwords
This level simulates this story, giving you a leak of /etc/shadow (in /challenge/shadow-leak). Crack it (this could take a few minutes), su to zardus, and run /challenge/run to get the flag

## Using SUDO
In this level, we will give you sudo access, and you will use it to read the flag. Nice and easy!
